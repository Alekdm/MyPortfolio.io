                                      <p>Hey there! My name is Alex, and I'm a 26-year-old from California. I'm a proud 
                                        dad, and I've always been fascinated by computers. It's amazing how you can let 
                                        your imagination run wild and create all sorts of things!<br><br>
                                        I got my first IT job back in October 2021, and I've been working hard to become
                                         a software engineer ever since, all without any formal education. I'm self-taught
                                          in HTML, CSS, and Python, and I'd say I'm an intermediate in those three languages.<br><br>
                                        
                                          I have successfully created two websites for small businesses, utilizing my skills in web development 
                                          and design to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that helped my clients stand out in 
                                          their respective markets. On the programming side, I have worked on various Python projects, including 
                                          a bot that automates the process of getting discounts on Bestbuy's website and exporting them to a server. 
                                          My expertise in Python extends beyond the basics, as I continue to dive deeper into advanced techniques to 
                                          build more sophisticated and powerful programs. I am also eager to expand my knowledge in Java and 
                                          leverage it for my future programming projects. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest programming 
                                          technologies and trends to provide the best solutions to my clients.<br><br>
                                        
                                        One of my greatest strengths as a programmer is my problem-solving skills, and I love 
                                        working with a team to tackle complex projects. Sure, I've faced challenges along the 
                                        way, especially in learning everything on my own, but I've found online tutorials and 
                                        solutions to be really helpful.<br><br>
                                        
                                        Outside of work, I love spending time with my daughter and dog. When I have free time,
                                         I like playing video games with my friends or practicing my Python skills. <br><br>
                                        
                                        For anyone who's just starting out in the world of programming and IT, my advice is to 
                                        always be open to learning and be prepared to use your brain to solve some complex problems!
                                         The most important things to me are my family and personal health, and they guide both my 
                                         work and personal life. Thanks for getting to know me!</p>
